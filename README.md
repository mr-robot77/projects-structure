**💭 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗳 𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗗𝗶𝗿𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀:**

**1️⃣ data/** → Stores datasets at different stages (raw, processed, external)  

**2️⃣ notebooks/** → Jupyter notebooks for step-by-step experimentation (data exploration, feature engineering, model training, evaluation)  

**3️⃣ src/** → Python scripts for modular operations:  

- **data/** → Handles data loading, cleaning, and splitting  
- **features/** → Implements feature selection and transformation  
- **models/** → Covers model training, prediction, and evaluation  
- **visualizations/** → Generates plots and insights  

**4️⃣ tests/** → Unit tests for verifying data pipelines, models, and visualizations  

**5️⃣ reports/** → Stores figures and final reports for documentation and presentations  

**6️⃣ docs/** → Project documentation, including installation, usage, and architecture  

**7️⃣ requirements.txt** → Lists necessary Python dependencies  

**8️⃣ .gitignore** → Prevents unnecessary files from being tracked in Git  

**9️⃣ LICENSE** → Defines usage rights for the project
